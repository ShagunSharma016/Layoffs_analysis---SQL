# Introduction
üìâ Exploring the Layoff Landscape
Layoffs have been a significant concern across industries, impacting employees and reshaping job markets worldwide. Understanding the trends, causes, and patterns behind layoffs can provide valuable insights for businesses, policymakers, and job seekers. This project dives deep into layoff data to uncover key insights through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
# Background
This project was driven by the need to analyze workforce reductions across different sectors, identify industries most affected, and observe trends over time
# Key Questions Explored
This project aims to analyze layoff trends over time and across different industries, countries, and company stages. The key questions explored include:

**1Ô∏è. Total Layoffs Per Year:**  
How many employees were laid off each year from 2020 to early 2023?  
How did the layoff trends change over time?

**2Ô∏è. Rolling Total of Layoffs:**  
What is the cumulative number of layoffs over time?  
How do layoffs progress month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter?

**3Ô∏è. Top 5 Companies with the Most Layoffs:**  
Which companies have laid off the most employees?  
Are there any patterns among these companies (e.g., industry, funding stage)?

**4Ô∏è. Top 5 Countries with the Most Layoffs:**  
Which countries have been most affected by layoffs?  
Are layoffs concentrated in specific regions?

**5Ô∏è. Top 5 Industries Affected by Layoffs:**  
Which industries have seen the highest number of layoffs?  
How do layoffs vary across tech, finance, healthcare, and other sectors?

**6Ô∏è. Top 5 Startup Stages Affected by Layoffs:**  
Do layoffs happen more frequently in early-stage startups or well-established companies?  
How do layoffs differ across different funding stages (Seed, Series A, B, etc.)?

# **üßπ Data Cleaning Skills Used**  
To ensure data accuracy and consistency, I performed several data cleaning steps, including:  

**1. Checking for Duplicates:**  
   - Identified and flagged duplicate records to avoid redundancy in analysis.  

**2. Populating Missing Values (If Possible):**  
   - Filled in missing values using logical approaches (e.g., using industry data to fill missing values for companies).  

**3. Removing Duplicates:**  
   - Eliminated duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.  

**4. Standardizing Data:**  
   - Ensured consistency in formatting (e.g., standardizing company names, country names, and date formats).  

**5. Working with Data Types:**  
   - Converted data into appropriate formats (e.g., ensuring dates were in `YYYY-MM-DD` format).  

**6. Handling Null Values:**  
   - Replaced or removed null values based on data relevance and availability.
